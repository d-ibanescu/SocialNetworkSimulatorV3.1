# DSMP Simulator Version 3.1

The DSMP Social Network Simulator can be used by researchers and users who want to benefit from the simple UI provided in this simulation tool to examine and compare different ML-based applications in a simulated social network environment. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed and configured on your system:

1.  **Git:** For cloning the repository. ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
2.  **Python (3.9 or 3.10):** The application requires **specifically Python 3.9 or 3.10**. Make sure the correct version is installed and accessible from your command line/terminal. ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) [Download 3.9 Release](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/))
    * *Tip:* Verify your installation by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`. On Windows, you might use `py --list` to see installed versions and `py -3.9` or `py -3.10` to invoke a specific one.
3.  **Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher):** Required for compiling and running the Java code. JDK 8 is preferred, but 9+ should work with the script's compatibility flags. Ensure `java` and `javac` are in your system's PATH. ([Download OpenJDK - Adoptium recommended](https://adoptium.net/))
    * *Tip:* Verify by running `java -version` and `javac -version`.
4.  **Apache Maven:** Used by the build script to download Java dependencies. Ensure `mvn` is in your system's PATH. ([Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) | [Installation Guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html))
    * *Tip:* Verify by running `mvn -version`.

**Important:** Ensure that the executable commands (`git`, `python`/`python3` or `py`, `java`, `javac`, `mvn`) for the prerequisites are available in your system's PATH environment variable. The build script relies on being able to call these tools directly.
## Installation 

1.  **Git Clone or Download the Repository**

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd SocialNetworkSimulatorV3
    ```

3.  **Run the Setup Command:**
    This is the recommended first step. It will:
    * Create a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) using your Python 3.9/3.10.
    * Install required Python packages (from `requirements.txt`) into the virtual environment.
    * Download necessary NLTK data (`punkt`, `wordnet`).
    * Download Java dependencies (using Maven) into the `lib` directory.
    * Compile the Java source code into the `classes` directory.

    Execute the command using your **Python 3.9 or 3.10** executable:

    * **Windows (using the `py` launcher):**
        ```bash
        py -3.9 build.py setup
        # OR
        py -3.10 build.py setup
        ```
    * **Linux/macOS (assuming `python3.9` or `python3.10` is in PATH):**
        ```bash
        python3.9 build.py setup
        # OR
        python3.10 build.py setup
        ```
    * *(If `python` or `python3` directly maps to 3.9/3.10):*
        ```bash
        python build.py setup
        ```

## Running the Simulator

Once the setup is complete, you can run the simulator using the `run` command with the build script. This will execute the compiled Java code using the correct classpath and necessary Java/JADE arguments, leveraging the Python virtual environment for any potential Python interactions needed by the Java code.

Use the **same Python 3.9/3.10 executable** you used for setup:

* **Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    python3.9 build.py run
    # OR
    python3.10 build.py run
    ```
* **Windows:**
    ```bash
    py -3.9 build.py run
    # OR
    py -3.10 build.py run
    ```
* *(If `python` or `python3` directly maps to 3.9/3.10):*
    ```bash
    python build.py run
    ```
## Build tool help

If you are developing on the DSMP platform, some of the build tool commands may be confusing. Here is the "man page" for the command:

```bash
--- SocialNetworkSimulatorV3 Build/Run Script (Requires Python 3.9 or 3.10) ---
usage: build.py [-h] [-v]
                [{install,compile,run,rebuild,setup,clean,clean-java,clean-python,info,help}]

Startup and Build Script for SocialNetworkSimulatorV3

## Troubleshooting

* **Command Not Found Errors:** Ensure Git, Python 3.9/3.10, JDK (java/javac), and Maven (mvn) are correctly installed and their directories are added to your system's PATH environment variable.
* **Incorrect Python Version Error:** Double-check that you are running the `build.py` script using a Python 3.9 or 3.10 interpreter. Use `python --version` or `py --list` to verify.
* **Build/Run Failures:**
    * Run `python build.py info` to check if the script detects your tools correctly.
    * Run the command with the `-v` (verbose) flag (e.g., `python build.py setup -v`) to see detailed output which might indicate the source of the problem.
    * Try cleaning and rebuilding: `python build.py clean` followed by `python build.py setup`.
    * Ensure you have a stable internet connection for downloading dependencies.
