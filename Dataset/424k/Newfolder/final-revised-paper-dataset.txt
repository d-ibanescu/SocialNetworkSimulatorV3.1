Virol J	15703085	2005-02-10	PMC549520	e6e5nvn9	background a recent publication reported that a tyrosinedependent sorting signal present in cytoplasmic tail of the spike protein of most coronaviruses mediates the intracellular retention of the spike protein this motif is missing from the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus sarscov resulting in high level of surface expression of the spike protein when it is expressed on its own in vitro presentation of the hypothesis it has been shown that the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus genome contains open reading frames that encode for proteins with no homologue in other coronaviruses one of them is the a protein which is expressed during infection in vitro and in vivo the a protein which contains a tyrosinedependent sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain is expressed on the cell surface and can undergo internalization in addition a can bind to the spike protein and through this interaction it may be able to cause the spike protein to become internalized resulting in a decrease in its surface expression testing the hypothesis the effects of a on the internalization of cell surface spike protein can be examined biochemically and the significance of the interplay between these two viral proteins during viral infection can be studied using reverse genetics methodology implication of the hypothesis if this hypothesis is proven it will indicate that the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus modulates the surface expression of the spike protein via a different mechanism from other coronaviruses the interaction between a and s which are expressed from separate subgenomic rna would be important for controlling the trafficking properties of s the cell surface expression of s in infected cells significantly impacts viral assembly viral spread and viral pathogenesis modulation by this unique pathway could confer certain advantages during the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus

BMC Bioinformatics	16042814	2005-07-26	PMC1183192	whoydkd5	background a new algorithm for assessing similarity between primer and template has been developed based on the hypothesis that annealing of primer to template is an information transfer process results primer sequence is converted to a vector of the full potential hydrogen numbers for g or c for a or t while template sequence is converted to a vector of the actual hydrogen bond numbers formed after primer annealing the former is considered as source information and the latter destination information an information coefficient is calculated as a measure for fidelity of this information transfer process and thus a measure of similarity between primer and potential annealing site on template conclusion successful prediction of pcr products from whole genomic sequences with a computer program based on the algorithm demonstrated the potential of this new algorithm in areas like in silico pcr and gene finding

J R Soc Interface	19535416	2010-02-06	PMC2842609	bze6g6jx	statistical inference for mechanistic models of partially observed dynamic systems is an active area of research most existing inference methods place substantial restrictions upon the form of models that can be fitted and hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses that can be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate them in contrast the socalled plugandplay methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions we show the utility of the plugandplay approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address specifically we demonstrate that plugandplay methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations we thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extrademographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification our approach is readily applicable to many other epidemiological and ecological systems
